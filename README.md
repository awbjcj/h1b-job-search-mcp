# H1B Job Search MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that automates H-1B job searching using **REAL** U.S. Department of Labor LCA disclosure data. Built with [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp).

🚀 **Live Server**: https://h1b-job-search-mcp.onrender.com/mcp

Note: Due to limitation of memory on the free instance, the server tends to go down. I'm happy to accept server donations for hosting.

## ✅ Real Data, Not Samples!

This server fetches **actual H-1B application data** directly from the U.S. Department of Labor's official disclosure files. Each dataset contains tens of thousands of real H-1B applications with:
- Real company names (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.)
- Actual job titles and salaries
- Real work locations and contact information
- Certified application statuses

**Data Source**: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance

## Features

- 📊 **Download LCA Data**: Automatically downloads and caches H-1B LCA disclosure data from the Department of Labor
- 🔍 **Smart Search**: Filter H-1B sponsoring companies by job role, location, and wage
- 🏢 **Company Analytics**: Get detailed sponsorship statistics for specific companies
- 📈 **Top Sponsors**: List top H-1B sponsoring companies by volume
- 🚫 **Agency Filtering**: Automatically filter out staffing agencies to find direct employers
- 📁 **Export Results**: Export filtered results to CSV for easy outreach
- 💾 **Data Caching**: Intelligent caching to avoid re-downloading large datasets
- 🤖 **Multi-LLM Support**: Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, and Poke

## 📖 How to Use

For detailed usage examples and natural language prompts, see the **[Usage Guide](USAGE_GUIDE.md)**.

### Quick Examples
Just talk naturally! The `ask` tool understands plain English:
- "Load the latest H-1B data"
- "Find software engineer jobs in California paying over 150k"
- "Tell me about Google's H-1B sponsorships"
- "Export data scientist positions to CSV"

## Available MCP Tools

### 1. `load_h1b_data`

  - `min_wage`: Minimum wage filter (optional)
  - `max_results`: Maximum results to return
  - `skip_agencies`: Skip staffing agencies (default: true)

Each returned position includes `company_stats`, calculated across all loaded
positions for that employer rather than only the filtered search results.

  - `max_results`: Maximum results to export

### 6. `get_available_data`
Check available LCA data periods and cached files.

### 7. `ask` (Natural Language Interface) 🎯
Talk to the H-1B search in simple English!
- **Usage**: Just describe what you want in plain language
- **Examples**:
  - "I'm a software engineer looking for jobs in the Bay Area"
  - "Show me data scientist positions paying over 180k"
  - "Which companies sponsor the most H-1B visas?"
  - "Tell me about Microsoft's H-1B program"

## Data Source

This tool uses publicly available LCA disclosure data from the U.S. Department of Labor's Foreign Labor Certification Data Center. The data includes:
- Employer information
- Job titles and wages
- Work locations
- Case status
- Contact information (when available)

**Note**: This data shows historical H-1B sponsorship patterns. Always verify current sponsorship policies with employers directly.

## Privacy & Legal

- All data used is publicly available from the U.S. Department of Labor
- No private or confidential information is accessed
- Use responsibly and professionally when contacting employers
- Respect company communication preferences

## Customization

Add custom filtering logic or additional tools by modifying `src/server.py`:

```python
@mcp.tool
def custom_analysis(parameter: str) -> dict:
    """Your custom H-1B data analysis."""
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Data not loading**: Check your internet connection and verify the year/quarter exists
- **No results found**: Try broader search terms or check different quarters
- **Memory issues**: The full dataset can be large; consider using `nrows` parameter in pandas
- **Cache issues**: Delete the `data_cache` directory to force fresh downloads
